# Data-Analysis-Projects
Here, I have developed 09 projects based on Data Analysis using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQL

The main objective of these projects to find the insights of data after cleanning the structured and unstructrured data using Python labries.

Project-1: Analysis on TMDb movie data
Project-2: Analysis on ncis and census data
Project-3: 

Project Steps:
In this project is going to discuss on various data which is collected from different sources using Python libraries(e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and so on) in Jupyter lab platform. Here, I have applied several cleaning process that create a visulization outcomes to meet the projects goals.

- Data Gathering
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visulization
  * Univariate analysis 
  * Bivariate analysis
  * Multivariate analysis
